# Ground-to-satellite-quantum-teleportation-
A simple simulation of a ground-to-satellite quantum teleportation system.

'testFidelity.m' is the main function, to run a single-shot teleportation, with adjustable noise and polarization distortin.

'measureBellState.m' is the function to accomplish incomplete measurement in Bell states.

'runFidelity.m' is to run 'testFidelity.m' a lot of times, to get the averaged fideility of the system.
